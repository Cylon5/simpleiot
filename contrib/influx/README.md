# Example Influx Queries

This directory contains a collection of example influx queries that can be used
to query data in Influx populated by Simple IoT.

These examples can be run by:

- Installing the
  [Influx CLI](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.5/reference/cli/influx/)
- setting up a config
- `influx query --file contrib/influx/simple.flux`

Generally, it seems easiest to write your queries in a text editor and then run
the query on the file.
