# Linking Nodes

## Issue

We are using the copy/paste functionality to link nodes.

Right now, nodes are linked by pressing the copy button on the node to link and pasting the ID into a text field on the node that will link to it.

We want to have a paste button there instead that will allow linking without the system clipboard, which is not available outside of localhost.

## Notes about existing code

- `PasteNode` function in `Top.elm`.
