# Installation

Simple IoT will run on the following systems:

- ARM/x86/RiscV Linux
- MacOS
- Windows

The computer you are currently using is a good platform to start with as well as
any common embedded Linux platform like the Raspberry PI or Beaglebone Black.

If you needed an industrial class device, consider something from embeddedTS
like the [TS-7553-V2](https://www.embeddedts.com/products/TS-7553-V2).

The Simple IoT application is a self contained binary with no dependencies.
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/simpleiot/simpleiot/releases)
for your platform and run the executable. Once running, you can log into the
user interface by opening [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in a
browser. The default login is:

- user: `admin@admin.com`
- pass: `admin`
