The Simple IoT [Go repository](https://github.com/simpleiot/simpleiot) contains
a number of Go packages useful for building cloud or edge applications for IoT
systems. There is also a
[standalone application](https://github.com/simpleiot/simpleiot/releases) that
is ready to run on most platforms.

Developers can view the Go
[package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/simpleiot/simpleiot).
