# Architecture

This document describes how the Simple IoT project fulfills the basic
requirements as described in the top level [README](../../).

There are two levels of architecture to consider:

- **[System](architecture-system.md)**: how multiple SIOT instances and other
  applications interact to form a system.
- **[Application](architecture-app.md)**: how the SIOT appliction is structured.
