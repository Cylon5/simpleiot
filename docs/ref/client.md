# Simple IoT Clients

**Contents**

Most functionality in Simple IoT is implemented in Clients.

Each client can be configured by one or more nodes in the SIOT store graph.
These nodes may be created by a user, a process that detects new plug and play
hardware, or other clients.

A client interacts with the system by listening for new points it is interested
in and sending out points as it acquires new data.

## Creating new clients

See [Development](development.md)

## Client lifecycle

It is important the clients cleanly implement the
[Start()/Stop() pattern](architecture-app.md#application-lifecycle) and shut
down cleanly when Stop() is called releasing all resources. If nodes are added
or removed, clients are started/stopped. Additionally if a child node of a
client config is added or removed, the entire client is stopped and then
restarted. This relieves the burden on the client from managing the
addition/removal of client functionality. Thus it is very important that clients
stop cleanly and release resources in case they are restarted.

## Message echo

Clients need to be aware of the "echo" problem as they typically subscribe as
well as publish to the `points` subject for the nodes they manage. When they
publish to these subjects, these messages will be echoed back to them. There are
several solutions:

1. create a new NATS connection for the client with the
   [NoEcho](https://docs.nats.io/using-nats/developer/connecting/noecho) option
   set. For this to work, each client will need to establish its own connection
   to the server. This may not work in cases where subjects are aliased into
   authenticated subject namespaces.
2. inspect the `Point` `Origin` field -- if is blank, then it was generated by
   the node that owns the point and does not need to be processed by the client
   generating the data for that node. If is not blank, then the Point was
   generated by a user, rule, or something other than the owning node and must
   be processed. This may not always work -- example: user is connected to a
   downstream instance and modifies a point that then propagates upstream -- it
   may get echo'd back to an authenticated client.
3. (investigation stage) A NATS messages header can be populated with the ID of
   the client that sent the message. If it is an authenticated client, then the
   message will not be echo'd on the authenticated client subject namespace of
   the same ID. This information is not stored, so cannot be used for auditing
   purposes.

The SIOT client manager filters out all points received with Origin set to a
blank string. Thus, if you want a point to get to a client, you must set the
Origin field. This helps ensure that the Origin field is used consistently as
otherwise stuff won't work.
