# Client Development

Most functionality in Simple IoT is implemented in Clients.

Each client is configured by one or more nodes in the SIOT store graph. These
nodes may be created by a user, a process that detects new plug and play
hardware, or other clients.

A client interacts with the system by listening for new points it is interested
in and sending out points as it aquires new data.

Simple IoT provides utilites that assist in creating new clients. See the
[Go package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/simpleiot/simpleiot/client)
for more information. A client manager is created for each client type. This
manager instantiates new client instances when new nodes are detected and then
sends point updates to the client.

Clients need to be aware of the "echo" problem as they typically subscribe as
well as publish to the `points` subject for the nodes they manage. When they
publish to these subjects, these messages will be echoed back to them. There are
two solutions:

1. create a new NATS connection for the client with the NoEcho option set.
1. inspect the `Point` `Origin` field -- if is blank, then it was generated by
   the node that owns the point. If is not blank, then the Point was generated
   by a user or rule and must be processed.
